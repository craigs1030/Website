<p id="Anto">Anthony Raftery was born in Killedan,Kiltimagh,Co.Mayo. He was almost blind from an attack of small-pox while very young and is said to have worked as a stable boy for the landlord, Frank Taaffe. While he had no formal education, Frank Taaffe's uncle, known locally as Friar Taaffe, was said to have taken an interest in teaching him. He is also said to have attended hedge schools all over south Galway. Raftery is said to have been banished after a dispute with the landlord. For years he lived between Tuam, Gort and Craughwell, where he died.

Raftery's only means of existence were his fiddle and his poetry. While he is said to have been only a very mean fiddler, he built up a formidable reputation as a folk poet. He was partial to such beauties as Breegeen Vesey and Maire ni hEidhin, which Yeats translated into English.

Raftery also wrote poems about the 'Whiteboys,' a secret society of the time. For this he was charged with sedition at the Galway Assizes. Although he didn't always see eye with the Church his Atharraigh Raifteiri is a very moving, religious poem.</p>

<p>None of Raftery's poetry was written down, but it remained in the folk memory until collected by Douglas Hyde around the turn of the 20th century. He is now recognized as one of Ireland's most foremost 19th century folk poets

Raftery is best remembered locally for his idyllic poem about his native Killedan which he described as a land of milk and honey:

'Killedan the village where everything grows, There are blackberries there and all that is good, And if I were standing in the midst of my people, Age would leave me and I'd be young once more'

'Cill Aodain an baile a bhasann gach nidh ann Ta smeardha subh croidh ann 'gus measardha gach sort. 'S da mbeinn-se 'mo sheasamh I gceart lar mo dhaoine, D'imeoidh an aois uaim agus bheinn aris og'.

Raftery died on 24th December 1834 and is buried in Killeeneen, Co. Galway.</p>

                              <p id="poem1"><b>Eanach Dhuin<br></b>
by Antoine O Raifteiri<br>

If my health is spared I'll be long relating<br>

Of that boat that sailed out of Anach Cuain.<br>
And the keening after of mother and father<br>
And child by the harbour, the mournful croon!<br>
King of Graces, who died to save us,<br>
T'were a small affair but for one or two,<br>
But a boat-load bravely in calm day sailing<br>
Without storm or rain to be swept to doom.<br>

What wild despair was on all the faces<br>

To see them there in the light of day,<br>
In every place there was lamentation,<br>
And tearing of hair as the wreck was shared.<br>
And boys there lying when crops were ripening,<br>
From the strength of life they were borne to clay<br>
In their wedding clothes for their wake they robed them<br>
O King of Glory, man's hope is in vain.<br></p> </section>
