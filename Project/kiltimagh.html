         <p> Kiltimagh is a small town, located in south east Mayo with a population of 1,069. Being such a small town, there is a very close community in this town with there being a huge participation in sport events and social events from the people living there.<br>The history of many small towns is rarely discussed, but when you look into the history of kiltimagh, you may be surprised what you could learn about this small town.</p>

    <p>For a town with a strong history of sports, you wouldn't think of literature when you think of Kiltimagh, but when you visit the Museum here, there are many examples of how this town valued literature throughout previous centuries.<br> Anthony Raftery, a blind poet from the 19th Century is the first name that comes to mind when discussing literature in Kiltimagh, with a couple of his poems still being taught in schools throughout the country.</p>
